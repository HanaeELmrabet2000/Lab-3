# Lab-3
<h3>Objectif</h3>
<p>The main purpose behind this lab is to get familiar with NLP language models using Sklearn library.</p>

In this NLP playground journey, we delve into the realm of language models to decode text data's nuances and insights. The first part focuses on predicting answer scores, where we preprocess text, extract features using various methods like Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec embeddings, and train regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and SVR. Through rigorous evaluation based on metrics like MSE, RMSE, and MAE, we find SVM as the standout performer, offering the most accurate predictions.

In the second part, our focus shifts to sentiment analysis on Twitter. Here, we preprocess tweets by removing URLs, punctuation, and emojis, and tokenize the text. Features are then extracted using TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, and Word2Vec embeddings, followed by training classification models like Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Evaluation based on accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall highlights Decision Tree as the top performer, showcasing remarkable performance across all metrics.
